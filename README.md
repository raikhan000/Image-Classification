# Image-Classification
This project focuses on:  
1) Developing and training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, leveraging data augmentation techniques and dropout for robustness and generalization.  
2) Creating both vanilla and advanced saliency maps to interpret model decisions, providing insights into feature importance and the network’s focus areas in image recognition tasks.  
3) Analyzing the saliency maps for a deeper understanding of CNN’s behaviour, contributing to model transparency and interpretability in image classification.
